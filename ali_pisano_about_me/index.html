<p>I am a former journalist and content marketer turned education operations professional. I believe everyone should have access to education and the opportunity to become lifelong learners, especially in the pursuit of relevant, 21st century skills. At General Assembly, I focus on instructor professional development and coaching, as well as strategic operations for GA's technical immersive, or full-time, programs.</p>

<h2>JOURNALISM + CONTENT MARKETING</h2>

<p>Writing is no longer the main focus of my job, but it's important to me that I incorporate it into my daily work regardless. I contribute to GA's global blog and other content marketing materials, in which I'm able to write about subjects I'm passionate about. My work covers trends in education, career strategies and industry thought leaders. Selected clips can be viewed <a href="writing.html">here</a>.</p>

<h2>EXTRACURRICULAR</h2>
<p> I love books, writing down my favorite quotes (recorded in a notebook I've had since I was 12), running outside and Old Fashioneds. My greatest ambition is to one day own a cat named Cat Stevens. </p>
